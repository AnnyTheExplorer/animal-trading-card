        A baby Pug has a greater probability to be born by caesarean section than most other breeds. They are born deaf, blind, and largely immobile. Thus, they rely on their mom, or breeder for food, warmth, and care. At eight weeks old, the Pug pups are developed enough - with their sight, hearing and mobility intact, to be able to leave their mom and littermates behind. They can then be sold and moved into a new loving home.

      I have always wanted to adopt my first pet at some point in my life. The pug pup didn't exactly suit the "cute" doggy aesthetic I would normally pick interest in... But, somehow I fell in love with the breed after seeing a movie - the actor was a pug dad. I love that the small size is maintained through it's growth, and I love the unconventional look. I will raise my own pug soon! â™¥
